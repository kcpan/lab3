The brand I am trying to communicate is whimsical, colorful, but also modern and clean. For the background of each panel, I have one of my past works, which are all very colorful and whimsical. However, the font choice and clean navigation bar gives off a more modern and clean feeling. The font is the same font used in Android for maximum readability, while also still stylish. There is not that much clutter, aside from the backgrounds, but they do not draw that much attention to them from the focuses, due to the white boxes I encapsulate the content in.

As a computer science major, I want to appeal to people looking for coders, but I do not have much to put in the projects section, so I decided to focus more on art. I put my artwork in the gallery, hopefully attracting UI/UX designers attention, by showing that I have some ability in the arts. I also made my page slightly interactive with alot of on-hover effects, nothing too fancy, but enough to keep the page exciting rather than just a non-interactive experience. My navigation bar also auto scrolls, which I think is a very nice feature for smooth transitions, compared to automatically snapping to a div.
